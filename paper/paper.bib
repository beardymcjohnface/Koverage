    abstract = "{Motivation: Counting the number of occurrences of every k-mer (substring of length k) in a long string is a central subproblem in many applications, including genome assembly, error correction of sequencing reads, fast multiple sequence alignment and repeat detection. Recently, the deep sequence coverage generated by next-generation sequencing technologies has caused the amount of sequence to be processed during a genome project to grow rapidly, and has rendered current k-mer counting tools too slow and memory intensive. At the same time, large multicore computers have become commonplace in research facilities allowing for a new parallel computational paradigm.Results: We propose a new k-mer counting algorithm and associated implementation, called Jellyfish, which is fast and memory efficient. It is based on a multithreaded, lock-free hash table optimized for counting k-mers up to 31 bases in length. Due to their flexibility, suffix arrays have been the data structure of choice for solving many string problems. For the task of k-mer counting, important in many biological applications, Jellyfish offers a much faster and more memory-efficient solution.Availability: The Jellyfish software is written in C++ and is GPL licensed.

In many metagenomics studies, the reads obtained from metagenomics sequencing are first assembled into longer contigs and these contigs are then binned into clusters of contigs where contigs in a cluster are expected to come from the same species. As different species may share common sequences in their genomes, one assembled contig may belong to multiple species. However, existing tools for binning contigs only support non-overlapped binning, i.e., each contig is assigned to at most one bin (species).},

  abstract = { Metagenomics enables the recovery of various genetic materials from different species, thus providing valuable insights into microbial communities. Metagenomic binning group sequences belong to different organisms, which is an important step in the early stages of metagenomic analysis pipelines. The classic pipeline followed in metagenomic binning is to assemble short reads into longer contigs and then bin these resulting contigs into groups representing different taxonomic groups in the metagenomic sample. Most of the currently available binning tools are designed to bin metagenomic contigs, but they do not make use of the assembly graphs that produce such assemblies. In this study, we propose MetaCoAG, a metagenomic binning tool that uses assembly graphs with the composition and coverage information of contigs. MetaCoAG estimates the number of initial bins using single-copy marker genes, assigns contigs into bins iteratively, and adjusts the number of bins dynamically throughout the binning process. We show that MetaCoAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art binning tools by producing similar or more high-quality bins than the second-best binning tool on both simulated and real datasets. To the best of our knowledge, MetaCoAG is the first stand-alone contig-binning tool that directly makes use of the assembly graph information along with other features of the contigs. }

	abstract = {Microbiota are closely associated to human health and disease. Metaproteomics can provide a direct means to identify microbial proteins in microbiota for compositional and functional characterization. However, in-depth and accurate metaproteomics is still limited due to the extreme complexity and high diversity of microbiota samples. One of the main challenges is constructing a protein sequence database that best fits the microbiota sample. Herein, we proposed an accurate taxonomic annotation pipeline from metagenomic data for deep metaproteomic coverage, namely contigs directed gene annotation (ConDiGA). We mixed 12 known bacterial species to derive a synthetic microbial community to benchmark metagenomic and metaproteomic pipelines. With the optimized taxonomic annotation strategy by ConDiGA, we built a protein sequence database from the metagenomic data for metaproteomic analysis and identified about 12,000 protein groups, which was very close to the result obtained with the reference proteome protein sequence database of the 12 species. We also demonstrated the practicability of the method in real fecal samples, achieved deep proteome coverage of human gut microbiome, and compared the function and taxonomy of gut microbiota at metagenomic level and metaproteomic level. Our study can tackle the current taxonomic annotation reliability problem in metagenomics-derived protein sequence database for metaproteomics. The unique dataset of metagenomic and the metaproteomic data of the 12 bacterial species is publicly available as a standard benchmarking sample for evaluating various analysis pipelines. The code of ConDiGA is open access at GitHub for the analysis of real microbiota samples.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

The coral surface mucus layer (SML) microbiome is very sensitive to external changes, as it constitutes the direct interface between the coral host and the environment. Here, we investigate whether the bacterial taxonomic and functional profiles in the coral SML are shaped by the local reef zone and explore their role in coral health and ecosystem functioning. The analysis was conducted using metagenomes and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) associated with the coral Pseudodiploria strigosa and the water column from two naturally distinct reef environments in Bermuda: inner patch reefs exposed to a fluctuating thermal regime and the more stable outer reefs. The microbial community structure in the coral SML varied according to the local environment, both at taxonomic and functional levels. The coral SML microbiome from inner reefs provides more gene functions that are involved in nutrient cycling (e.g., photosynthesis, phosphorus metabolism, sulfur assimilation) and those that are related to higher levels of microbial activity, competition, and stress response. In contrast, the coral SML microbiome from outer reefs contained genes indicative of a carbohydrate-rich mucus composition found in corals exposed to less stressful temperatures and showed high proportions of microbial gene functions that play a potential role in coral disease, such as degradation of lignin-derived compounds and sulfur oxidation. The fluctuating environment in the inner patch reefs of Bermuda could be driving a more beneficial coral SML microbiome, potentially increasing holobiont resilience to environmental changes and disease.},

    abstract = {Chardonnay is the basis of some of the world’s most iconic wines and its success is underpinned by a historic program of clonal selection. There are numerous clones of Chardonnay available that exhibit differences in key viticultural and oenological traits that have arisen from the accumulation of somatic mutations during centuries of asexual propagation. However, the genetic variation that underlies these differences remains largely unknown. To address this knowledge gap, a high-quality, diploid-phased Chardonnay genome assembly was produced from single-molecule real time sequencing, and combined with re-sequencing data from 15 different Chardonnay clones. There were 1620 markers identified that distinguish the 15 clones. These markers were reliably used for clonal identification of independently sourced genomic material, as well as in identifying a potential genetic basis for some clonal phenotypic differences. The predicted parentage of the Chardonnay haplomes was elucidated by mapping sequence data from the predicted parents of Chardonnay (Gouais blanc and Pinot noir) against the Chardonnay reference genome. This enabled the detection of instances of heterosis, with differentially-expanded gene families being inherited from the parents of Chardonnay. Most surprisingly however, the patterns of nucleotide variation present in the Chardonnay genome indicate that Pinot noir and Gouais blanc share an extremely high degree of kinship that has resulted in the Chardonnay genome displaying characteristics that are indicative of inbreeding.},

abstract = {Abstract Background and Aims The Chardonnay clone Gingin was imported into Western Australia in 1957 and has become one of Australia's oldest recognised Chardonnay clones. While its phenotypic similarity to other Chardonnay clones has been noted, its origins and relatedness to these clones remains a mystery. This study builds on previous Chardonnay clonal marker research to uncover the origins of Gingin. Methods and Results Samples of Gingin and clones suspected to be related to Gingin were sequenced and analysed in a marker discovery pipeline along with previously sequenced Chardonnay clones. Sequencing data for previously uncharacterised samples were also included. Clonal markers were identified for all samples and a new phylogeny for all sequenced Chardonnay clones was built which revealed that Gingin is related to other clones. Conclusions The results are consistent with Gingin being a selection of an old University of California, Davis/Foundation Plant Services clone called Chardonnay-1, from which the clone OF Chard was derived. It is also related to the clone Mendoza, but the origin of this clone is still unclear. Significance of the Study This study demonstrates the potential of clonal genetic markers for the identification of grapevine clones, and in helping to unravel their origin and to establish their heritage; in this example shedding light on a 60-year-old mystery and opening the door for authenticity testing of these important clones.},

However, most human microbiome studies focus on bacteria, ignoring free and integrated phages, so we know little about how these prophages affect the human microbiome. We compared the prophages identified in 11,513 bacterial genomes isolated from human body sites to characterise prophage DNA in the human microbiome. Here, we show that prophage DNA comprised an average of 1-5\% of each bacterial genome. The prophage content per genome varies with the isolation site on the human body, the health of the human, and whether the disease was symptomatic.

	abstract = {Phages dominate every ecosystem on the planet. While virulent phages sculpt the microbiome by killing their bacterial hosts, temperate phages provide unique growth advantages to their hosts through lysogenic conversion. Many prophages benefit their host, and prophages are responsible for genotypic and phenotypic differences that separate individual microbial strains. However, the microbes also endure a cost to maintain those phages: additional DNA to replicate and proteins to transcribe and translate. We have never quantified those benefits and costs. Here, we analysed over two and a half million prophages from over half a million bacterial genome assemblies. Analysis of the whole dataset and a representative subset of taxonomically diverse bacterial genomes demonstrated that the normalised prophage density was uniform across all bacterial genomes above 2 Mbp. We identified a constant carrying capacity of phage DNA per bacterial DNA. We estimated that each prophage provides cellular services equivalent to approximately 2.4 \% of the cell{\textquoteright}s energy or 0.9 ATP per bp per hour. We demonstrate analytical, taxonomic, geographic, and temporal disparities in identifying prophages in bacterial genomes that provide novel targets for identifying new phages. We anticipate that the benefits bacteria accrue from the presence of prophages balance the energetics involved in supporting prophages. Furthermore, our data will provide a new framework for identifying phages in environmental datasets, diverse bacterial phyla, and from different locations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

               microbiome) exist throughout the human body, with fundamental
               roles in human health and disease. The National Institutes of
               Health (NIH)-funded Human Microbiome Project Consortium has
               established a population-scale framework to develop metagenomic
               protocols, resulting in a broad range of quality-controlled
               resources and data including standardized methods for creating,
               processing and interpreting distinct types of high-throughput
               metagenomic data available to the scientific community. Here we
               present resources from a population of 242 healthy adults
               sampled at 15 or 18 body sites up to three times, which have
               generated 5,177 microbial taxonomic profiles from 16S ribosomal
               RNA genes and over 3.5 terabases of metagenomic sequence so far.
               In parallel, approximately 800 reference strains isolated from
               the human body have been sequenced. Collectively, these data
               represent the largest resource describing the abundance and
               variety of the human microbiome, while providing a framework for
               current and future studies. The Human Microbiome Project
               Consortium has established a population-scale framework to study
               a variety of microbial communities that exist throughout the
               human body, enabling the generation of a range of
               quality-controlled data as well as community resources. The
               Human Microbiome Project (HMP), supported by the National
               Institutes of Health Common Fund, has the goal of characterizing
               the microbial communities that inhabit and interact with the
               human body in sickness and in health. In two Articles in this
               issue of Nature, the HMP Consortium presents the first
               population-scale details of the organismal and functional
               composition of the microbiota across five areas of the body. An
               associated News \& Views discusses the initial results ---
               which, along with those of a series of co-publications, already
               constitute the most extensive catalogue of organisms and genes
