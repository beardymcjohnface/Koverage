    abstract = "{Motivation: Counting the number of occurrences of every k-mer (substring of length k) in a long string is a central subproblem in many applications, including genome assembly, error correction of sequencing reads, fast multiple sequence alignment and repeat detection. Recently, the deep sequence coverage generated by next-generation sequencing technologies has caused the amount of sequence to be processed during a genome project to grow rapidly, and has rendered current k-mer counting tools too slow and memory intensive. At the same time, large multicore computers have become commonplace in research facilities allowing for a new parallel computational paradigm.Results: We propose a new k-mer counting algorithm and associated implementation, called Jellyfish, which is fast and memory efficient. It is based on a multithreaded, lock-free hash table optimized for counting k-mers up to 31 bases in length. Due to their flexibility, suffix arrays have been the data structure of choice for solving many string problems. For the task of k-mer counting, important in many biological applications, Jellyfish offers a much faster and more memory-efficient solution.Availability: The Jellyfish software is written in C++ and is GPL licensed.

  abstract={Metagenomic sequencing allows us to study the structure, diversity and ecology in microbial communities without the necessity of obtaining pure cultures. In many metagenomics studies, the reads obtained from metagenomics sequencing are first assembled into longer contigs and these contigs are then binned into clusters of contigs where contigs in a cluster are expected to come from the same species. As different species may share common sequences in their genomes, one assembled contig may belong to multiple species. However, existing tools for binning contigs only support non-overlapped binning, i.e., each contig is assigned to at most one bin (species).},

  abstract = { Metagenomics enables the recovery of various genetic materials from different species, thus providing valuable insights into microbial communities. Metagenomic binning group sequences belong to different organisms, which is an important step in the early stages of metagenomic analysis pipelines. The classic pipeline followed in metagenomic binning is to assemble short reads into longer contigs and then bin these resulting contigs into groups representing different taxonomic groups in the metagenomic sample. Most of the currently available binning tools are designed to bin metagenomic contigs, but they do not make use of the assembly graphs that produce such assemblies. In this study, we propose MetaCoAG, a metagenomic binning tool that uses assembly graphs with the composition and coverage information of contigs. MetaCoAG estimates the number of initial bins using single-copy marker genes, assigns contigs into bins iteratively, and adjusts the number of bins dynamically throughout the binning process. We show that MetaCoAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art binning tools by producing similar or more high-quality bins than the second-best binning tool on both simulated and real datasets. To the best of our knowledge, MetaCoAG is the first stand-alone contig-binning tool that directly makes use of the assembly graph information along with other features of the contigs. },

	abstract = {Microbiota are closely associated to human health and disease. Metaproteomics can provide a direct means to identify microbial proteins in microbiota for compositional and functional characterization. However, in-depth and accurate metaproteomics is still limited due to the extreme complexity and high diversity of microbiota samples. One of the main challenges is constructing a protein sequence database that best fits the microbiota sample. Herein, we proposed an accurate taxonomic annotation pipeline from metagenomic data for deep metaproteomic coverage, namely contigs directed gene annotation (ConDiGA). We mixed 12 known bacterial species to derive a synthetic microbial community to benchmark metagenomic and metaproteomic pipelines. With the optimized taxonomic annotation strategy by ConDiGA, we built a protein sequence database from the metagenomic data for metaproteomic analysis and identified about 12,000 protein groups, which was very close to the result obtained with the reference proteome protein sequence database of the 12 species. We also demonstrated the practicability of the method in real fecal samples, achieved deep proteome coverage of human gut microbiome, and compared the function and taxonomy of gut microbiota at metagenomic level and metaproteomic level. Our study can tackle the current taxonomic annotation reliability problem in metagenomics-derived protein sequence database for metaproteomics. The unique dataset of metagenomic and the metaproteomic data of the 12 bacterial species is publicly available as a standard benchmarking sample for evaluating various analysis pipelines. The code of ConDiGA is open access at GitHub for the analysis of real microbiota samples.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The coral holobiont is comprised of a highly diverse microbial community that provides key services to corals such as protection against pathogens and nutrient cycling. The coral surface mucus layer (SML) microbiome is very sensitive to external changes, as it constitutes the direct interface between the coral host and the environment. Here, we investigate whether the bacterial taxonomic and functional profiles in the coral SML are shaped by the local reef zone and explore their role in coral health and ecosystem functioning. The analysis was conducted using metagenomes and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) associated with the coral Pseudodiploria strigosa and the water column from two naturally distinct reef environments in Bermuda: inner patch reefs exposed to a fluctuating thermal regime and the more stable outer reefs. The microbial community structure in the coral SML varied according to the local environment, both at taxonomic and functional levels. The coral SML microbiome from inner reefs provides more gene functions that are involved in nutrient cycling (e.g., photosynthesis, phosphorus metabolism, sulfur assimilation) and those that are related to higher levels of microbial activity, competition, and stress response. In contrast, the coral SML microbiome from outer reefs contained genes indicative of a carbohydrate-rich mucus composition found in corals exposed to less stressful temperatures and showed high proportions of microbial gene functions that play a potential role in coral disease, such as degradation of lignin-derived compounds and sulfur oxidation. The fluctuating environment in the inner patch reefs of Bermuda could be driving a more beneficial coral SML microbiome, potentially increasing holobiont resilience to environmental changes and disease.},

    abstract = {Microbial communities have a profound impact on both human health and various environments. Viruses infecting bacteria, known as bacteriophages or phages, play a key role in modulating bacterial communities within environments. High-quality phage genome sequences are essential for advancing our understanding of phage biology, enabling comparative genomics studies and developing phage-based diagnostic tools. Most available viral identification tools consider individual sequences to determine whether they are of viral origin. As a result of challenges in viral assembly, fragmentation of genomes can occur, and existing tools may recover incomplete genome fragments. Therefore, the identification and characterization of novel phage genomes remain a challenge, leading to the need of improved approaches for phage genome recovery.We introduce Phables, a new computational method to resolve phage genomes from fragmented viral metagenome assemblies. Phables identifies phage-like components in the assembly graph, models each component as a flow network, and uses graph algorithms and flow decomposition techniques to identify genomic paths. Experimental results of viral metagenomic samples obtained from different environments show that Phables recovers on average over 49 percent more high-quality phage genomes compared to existing viral identification tools. Furthermore, Phables can resolve variant phage genomes with over 99 percent average nucleotide identity, a distinction that existing tools are unable to make.Phables is available on GitHub at https://github.com/Vini2/phables.},
